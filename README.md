Jackie's Thesis Code

run `racket -t racket_tictactoe.rkt` to run the racket version of Tic Tac Toe,
or `ghc -Wall -fno-warn-tabs -o haskell_tic_tac_toe_exec TicTacToe.hs && ./haskell_tic_tac_toe_exec`
to run the Haskell version. Both are very much a work in progress. The thesis text is not yet available.
